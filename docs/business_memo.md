# Business Memo: FY 2022 Performance Review

**To:** Key Stakeholders (Foundation Group)
**From:** Luis Fernando Jordan, Senior Data Analyst
**Date:** January 24, 2026
**Subject:** FY 2022 Growth Drivers & Portfolio Diversification Analysis

---

## 1. Executive Summary
In Fiscal Year 2022, the consolidated portfolio generated **$861,952 in Net Revenue**. The analysis indicates a healthy transition from a single-store dependency to a diversified portfolio. Notably, revenue growth was **volume-driven (+Orders)** rather than price-driven, validating the market's reception of the new product lines despite a lower Average Order Value (AOV).

## 2. Strategic Insights

### A. Growth Mechanics: Volume is King
The Revenue Bridge analysis isolates the impact of Volume (Quantity) vs. Price (Unit Revenue).
* **Insight:** The positive revenue variance was driven almost entirely by increased transaction volume (5,651 Total Orders).
* **Implication:** Demand is high, but pricing power is static. The strategy of expanding the customer base has worked, but there is an opportunity to review pricing tiers in Q3 2023 to improve margins without sacrificing volume.

### B. Successful Diversification (Risk Reduction)
* **Pre-2022 Status:** High risk exposure; revenue was ~90% dependent on the legacy store (PA).
* **2022 Outcome:** By Q4, the "Revenue Share" chart demonstrates a balanced ecosystem. Newer storefronts (RBN and VIC) now command a significant portion of the daily revenue mix.
* **Takeaway:** The group is no longer vulnerable to the performance of a single brand.

## 3. Recommendations
1.  **Pricing Strategy:** Conduct a price elasticity test on top-performing SKUs in the RBN store to see if AOV can be lifted without dampening the strong order volume.
2.  **Inventory Management:** Utilize the Q2 trend data to lock in supply chain orders 3 months in advance for the upcoming Spring season to avoid stockouts.
